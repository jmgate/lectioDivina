1. *Praeparatio:*  **Prepare** your heart to meet God in his word.  "May the
   words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your
   sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer" (Psalm 19:14, ESV).
1. *Lectio:*  **Read** the passage slowly several times through.  Focus on the
   text itself, as opposed to footnotes, etc.
1. *Meditatio:*  **Meditate** upon the text.  Visualize it along several
   dimensions, both spatial and temporal.  Remember times in your life that
   relate to the text.
1. *Oratio:*  **Pray** God's word back to him.
1. *Contemplatio:*  **Rest** in the Lord as you meet him through his word.  "O
   Lord, may you be present in my life right now as I rest in your word.
   Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening" (from 1 Samuel 3:10).
   Cultivate an extended period of listening to God in silence.
1. *Actio:*  Articulate how your life needs to **change** because of your
   encounter with God through his word.

## John 14:1&ndash;11

> "Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.  In
> My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told
> you.  I go to prepare a place for you.  And if I go and prepare a place for
> you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you
> may be also.  And where I go you know, and the way you know."

> Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can
> we know the way?

> Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to
> the Father except through me.

> "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on
> you know Him and have seen Him."

> Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us."

> Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known
> Me, Philip?  He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say,
> 'Show us the Father'?  Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the
> Father in Me?  The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own
> authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works.  Believe Me that
> I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of
> the works themselves.
