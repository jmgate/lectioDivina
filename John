## John 14:1&ndash;11

> "Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me.  In
> My Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told
> you.  I go to prepare a place for you.  And if I go and prepare a place for
> you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you
> may be also.  And where I go you know, and the way you know."

> Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can
> we know the way?

> Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to
> the Father except through me.

> "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on
> you know Him and have seen Him."

> Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us."

> Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known
> Me, Philip?  He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say,
> 'Show us the Father'?  Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the
> Father in Me?  The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own
> authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works.  Believe Me that
> I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of
> the works themselves.
