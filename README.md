# Lectio Divina

1. *Praeparatio:*  **Prepare** your heart to meet God in his word.  "May the
   words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your
   sight, O Lord, my strength and my redeemer" (Psalm 19:14, ESV).
1. *Lectio:*  **Read** the passage slowly several times through.  Focus on the
   text itself, as opposed to footnotes, etc.
1. *Meditatio:*  **Meditate** upon the text.  Visualize it along several
   dimensions, both spatial and temporal.  Remember times in your life that
   relate to the text.
1. *Oratio:*  **Pray** God's word back to him.
1. *Contemplatio:*  **Rest** in the Lord as you meet him through his word.  "O
   Lord, may you be present in my life right now as I rest in your word.
   Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening" (from 1 Samuel 3:10).
   Cultivate an extended period of listening to God in silence.
1. *Actio:*  Articulate how your life needs to **change** because of your
   encounter with God through his word.
